TF700 can be used on all types of flooring, including vinyl tile, sheet flooring, terrazzo, marble, quarry tile, blue stone, Mexican tile, ceramic tile, concrete, granite and sealed wood. At a higher recommended concentration, a single application of TF700 creates a micro-profile on any type of flooring, significantly increasing slip resistance characteristics. When used at lower concentrations, TF700 can be used to effectively clean all types of flooring in restaurants, cafeterias, food courts, restrooms, and entrances and walkways, while maintaining positive slip resistance characteristics. TF700 can be applied with either a mop or automatic scrubber and will not cause a build-up with routine use. Field use has produced an average increase in slip resistance of 0.1 SCOF (Static Coefficient of Friction) per application. TF700 helps any type of floor meet or exceed the slip resistance recommendations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Floor Safety Institute (NFSI) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n\n",
